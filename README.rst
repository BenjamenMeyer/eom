EOM: Experimental OpenStack WSGI Middleware
===========================================

Incubator and playground project for general OpenStack API middleware.

So far, includes verb-based ACL enforcement and basic rate limiting. This stuff should be contributed upstream once it stabilizes and it has been
shown the middleware adds value to OpenStack use cases, generally
speaking.
